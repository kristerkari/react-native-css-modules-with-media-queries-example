# React Native CSS modules with CSS Media Queries example

This example app re-implements ["Responsive Full Width Tabs" demo](https://tympanus.net/Blueprints/FullWidthTabs/) from Tympanus Codrops website in React Native.

The example app should look exactly the same in both browser and React Native.

To see code examples, have a look at [styles.css](/src/styles.css) and [App.js](/src/App.js) inside `src` folder.

Have a look at the documentation if you want to add React Native CSS modules to your own project:
